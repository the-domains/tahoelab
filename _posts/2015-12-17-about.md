**The finest splitboards and snowboards in the world**

TahoeLab uses the highest quality materials and construction techniques to make unique, light, snappy, and bombproof snowboards/splitboards. Hand profiled bamboo cores and full sheets of carbon fiber give TahoeLab boards a distinct ride that's extremely durable yet super lively. TahoeLab is a rider owned company with a combined total of 30 years riding experience. Accompanied by engineering and business degrees, Lee Collins and Abe Greenspan are knowledgeable and passionate about building products that RIP and last.

**100% handmade in Lake Tahoe**

These boys put their gear through the toughest challenges snowboarding has to offer. TahoeLab was founded after continual gear malfunctions and the realization that most boards just don't RIP, so they decided to take matters into their own hands. Abe and Lee of TahoeLab have extensive technical backgrounds in snowboard manufacturing and tuning. Their race and freeride styles aid in creating a product that is tried and true.

**If there is a perfect recipe for an up and coming brand, these guys are it!**
