**100% handmade in Lake Tahoe**

These boys put their gear through the toughest challenges snowboarding has to offer. TahoeLab was founded after continual gear malfunctions and the realization that most boards just don't RIP, so they decided to take matters into their own hands. Abe and Lee of TahoeLab have extensive technical backgrounds in snowboard manufacturing and tuning. Their race and freeride styles aid in creating a product that is tried and true.

**If there is a perfect recipe for an up and coming brand, these guys are it!**
